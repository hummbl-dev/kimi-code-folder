# Kimi Code CLI Documentation

> Comprehensive documentation for working with Kimi Code CLI — an AI-powered coding agent by MoonshotAI.

## Quick Start

```
New to Kimi Code? → Read the [User Guide](./USER-GUIDE.md)
Want the details? → Check [Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md)
Need a reference? → See [Tools](./TOOLS.md) or [Skills](./SKILLS.md)
Looking for patterns? → Browse [Examples](./EXAMPLES.md)
```

## What is Kimi Code CLI?

Kimi Code CLI is an autonomous AI coding assistant that operates in your terminal and IDE. It can:

- **Read and edit code files** — partial or full file operations with precision
- **Execute shell commands** — run scripts, install dependencies, deploy applications
- **Search and analyze codebases** — find patterns across entire projects
- **Fetch web resources** — research APIs, documentation, latest information
- **Spawn parallel subagents** — delegate complex multi-part tasks efficiently
- **Access specialized skills** — deploy to Vercel/Netlify, generate images, process PDFs, and more

## Key Principles

### 1. Parallel Execution
Kimi Code can make multiple independent tool calls simultaneously. Structure requests to leverage this:

```
❌ "First read file A, then read file B, then fix both"
✅ "Fix auth.ts, update tests in auth.test.ts, and update README"
```

### 2. Outcome Over Implementation
Describe **what** you want, not **how** to do it:

```
❌ "Use axios.get on line 45 and add error handling with try-catch"
✅ "Fetch user data from the API and handle network errors gracefully"
```

### 3. Subagent Isolation
Subagents work in isolation and report back. Use them for:
- Independent tasks that can run in parallel
- Context isolation (debugging, research, exploration)
- Large codebase analysis (split across modules)

### 4. Skill Auto-Detection
Kimi Code automatically identifies relevant skills based on context. You can also request specific ones:

```
"Deploy this to Vercel" → Auto-uses vercel-deploy skill
"Use the vercel-deploy skill to set up preview deployments" → Explicit
```
